## Description
Explain what the project does.
It is the game of Sokoban

### Features
Describe what your major decisions were and why you did things that way.

### Issues
What did you have trouble with?  What did you learn?  What doesn't work?  Be honest.  You might be penalized if you claim something works and it doesn't.

I had trouble with bounds it took me a long time to figure it out to get it to partially work, but the game still does not function as it should and it moves boxes that are far away from the player.

### Extra Credit
Anything special you did.  This is required to earn bonus points.

I added my own image for detecting a win, although I don't know if a win is possible because it's not working correctly.

I used the class notes on matrices. I watched Youtube videos on bounds, but didn't find them helpful.
